## About Me
Hi, my name is Wilson and I am currently a senior at UCSD majoring in ***Mathematics - Computer Science*** with a minor in ***Cognitive Science***.

Currently I am employed as a Cybersecurity Tech Fellow Manager at **CodePath**, where I serve as the mentor for 25 different Tech Fellows across the country to teach the topics of Cybersecurity to students. Additionally, I am also conducting [research](#my-research) on liver diseases using machine learning techniques.

My favorite quote when it comes to programming has to be the following from Brain W. Kernighan.

> Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if youâ€™re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?

Like other programmers, my first line of code was the famous

``` python
def main():
    print("Hello World!")
```

## Interests
Outside of academics, here are my interests:
- Video Games
- Cool New Technnology
  - "Old technology" too
- Space Exploration
  - Here is a picture of a [rocket being caught](/image.png) by "chopsticks" as I find it very interesting.
- Food

## My Research
Outside of the classroom I am currently involved in medical machine learning research within the Department of Gastroentrology and Hepatology over at UC San Diego Health. 

Below are some of the work I've been part of:

1. [Automated Liver Segmentation Using MRI Proton Density Fat Fraction: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models.](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2024/10001/s1803_automated_liver_segmentation_using_mri.1804.aspx) 
2. [Machine Learning Differentiation of Pediatric NAFLD and Adult NASH Using Couinaud Liver PDFF Maps.](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2024/10001/s1730_machine_learning_differentiation_of.1731.aspx)
